Part 3 – Questions

1. Describe how the assembly changes with different k-mer values using the assembly
statistics you have collected. How does the contig length distribution change?

Good assembly graphs are heavily dependent on k-mer sizes, especially because smaller k-mers produce shorter
contigs with more connections than longer k-mers. Choosing the best k-mer size depends
on read length and depth, and it's pretty obvious if you've chosen one that's too big
or conversely too small. A graph comprised of smaller sub-graphs probably has disparate
contigs with no connections to others, and the k-mer might be too big (i.e. all three
k-mer sizes at a coverage cut-off of 60), and the opposite can happen if the k-mer
is too small.

2. How does an increased coverage cutoff affect the assembly? What is happening to the
de Bruijin graph when you change the value of this parameter? How does velvet
calculate its value for ‘auto’?

Like I mentioned above, a large cut-off leads to sub-graph clumps. The cut-off of 20 must
have been ideal for all three k-mer sizes because the "auto" graph for k-mer sizes
is identical to the cut-off of 20 for all three graphs. The "auto" coverage cut-off
is set by Velvet to half the length weighted median contig coverage depth, and the
de Bruijin graph will skew further to the left.

3. How does increasing minimum contig length affect your contig length distribution and
N50?

Increasing the minimum contig length decreases the total number of contigs, which lowers the N50.
